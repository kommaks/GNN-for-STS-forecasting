# GNN-for-STS-forecasting

This repository includes our works on Graph representation learning and its application on Cash Demand Prediction

The file structure is listed as follows:

1 T-GCN is the source codes for the paper named “T-GCN: A Temporal Graph Convolutional Network for Traffic Prediction” published at IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (T-ITS) which forged the T-GCN model model the spatial and temporal dependence simultaneously.

2 A3T-GCN is the source codes for the paper named “A3T-GCN: Attention Temporal Graph Convolutional Network for Traffic Forecasting” published at ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information which strengthen the T-GCN model model with attention structure.
